# CourseGraph

The course search software offered by UCSC (and most colleges) kind of sucks, and there is no easy way to explore classes and majors without a counselor – and the counselors could probably use some help too!

Solution? CourseGraph, a webapp that will:

+ datamine pisa and the registrar for course information and sections (and major / minor requirements if we can do that)
+ display this information visually as a web of interdependent courses and major requirements, filterable and presented through different layers and views

Technology: we will need

 + a web frontend (probably React, Typescript, D3) and people interested in UX and software design (myself included)
 + a web backend (probably node) and people interested in backend development and data storage / retrieval
 + several web crawlers to datamine UCSC sites and maybe others; anyone interested in this please apply!
+ possible integration of other web services (if we could embed eg. ratemyprofessors that would be awesome)

Is this feasible in <5 weeks?

 + Yes, but it will be challenging as we'll have a lot of work to do
 + Plus side is we all get to wear lots of hats and use a lot of cool tech to build a real tool that students and counselors can use to explore class options and make planning schedules a lot easier
 + This project can be subdivided with 2-3 teams working in parallel on different components (eg. frontend and data mining), so we should be able to work without too many bottlenecks

You do NOT need to have experience with typescript, react, node, or d3 to join this project, just a good attitude and a willingness to learn and contribute.

That said, you will need time to learn a bit of typescript and either frontend (react, d3), backend (node, databases – ask Ivan), or data mining (web crawlers, either node or python), since we'll probably be splitting into sub-teams that focus on one of those categories. And you'll need to do this fairly quickly (ie. over the next few weeks) since we'll need to hit the ground running as soon as possible. Oh, and if you'd like to do project management (as one of your many hats) that would be very useful too.

I'll be learning react and d3 over the next week or so, so if you're interested in that (whether you're a part of this team or not) please hit me up! (ssemery@ucsc.edu)
